    <h1 id="head1"> A Wyckoffian view on the 2021 BTC bull run. </h1>
    

<p>The most recent bull run started in early February 2021 and ended almost 2 months later. Quite a few people noticed that it behaved almost in direct accordance with the <a class = "textlink" href="https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method">Wyckoffian theory</a>. In this article, we analyse it in detail. </p>

<p>The notion of a <b>Composite Operator</b> (C.O.) or Composite Person is central to Wyckoff. He proposed a concept where we should think of a single person operating on the market. This represents big institutional players (aka whales), whose behaviour is usually quite different from average retail traders. C.O. always acts to his own benefit, so he wants to buy low and sell high.</p>  

<p>C.O accumulates assets gradually, without causing too much market movement.  Here is a graph starting at 2020-07-25:  </p>

<p>daily volumes began to exceed 1.5 * 10^9 USDT only during the first major bull run towards 20 000.</p>
<p> Volume really explodes in early January: </p>
<p id = "imgc"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70851370/120921503-e64e3080-c6bb-11eb-9aa0-827e04384bbc.jpg" width= "510" height= "45" </p>
<p>We call this phase a buying climax (BCLX). According to Wyckoff, it is also characterised by wide price bars. Let’s plot daily highs and lows with dashed lines:</p>
<p id = "imgc"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70851370/120907431-4790e800-c659-11eb-9fc7-2ec4ae5d6982.jpg" width= "510" height= "45" </p>
<p>Climbing towards peak values, volatility remained relatively high</p>
<p id = "imgc"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70851370/120907473-a5253480-c659-11eb-942f-af762188a934.jpg" width= "510" height= "45"</p>
<p> The next stage in Wyckoff model is automatic reaction (AR). It is characterised by a sharp sudden decrease. This is perhaps the most ambiguous position of a stock- either reaccumulation or distribution will follow. Looking at volume, we see another spike after AR which confirms reaccumulation-  we should wait for another bullish wave.  </p>
 <p id = "imgc"> <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70851370/120921816-7ccf2180-c6bd-11eb-9af2-c8d33b4fe5f4.jpg" width= "510" height= "45" </p>
	 
<p> The real Buying climax occurs at a third volume peak just above 55 000.  A resistance level is formed and AR gives us a support level.
The asset has now gained some momentum and a second rise (which Wyckoff dubs secondary test, ST) is expected. This is an opportunity for the C.O. to sell off a lot of his holdings to panic buyers and momentum traders who attempt to hop on the upward trend. Wyckoff expects relatively high volumes at this stage confirming the supply generated by C.O. 
</p>
   <p  id = "imgc" > <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70851370/120922398-d1c06700-c6c0-11eb-9d0b-31db3913e108.jpg" width= "510" height= "45" </p>
	   
<p>Multiple ST’s can happen which adjust the resistance and support levels slightly. A slight dip in volume corresponds to what Wyckoff calls Sign of Weakness (SOW). This alerts us of the final upcoming rally.</p>
<p id = "imgc" > <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70851370/120923073-709a9280-c6c4-11eb-8741-76a282cd1fd7.jpg" width= "510" height= "45"</p>
<p> Upthrust after distribution (UTAD) is a rare event which actually does take place in our case. It drives the stock above the resistance level and is marked by an increased volume. The price can hover at a new absolute high for days or even weeks which does not happen to Bitcoin in our case. </p>

<p id = "imgc"> <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70851370/120923705-cde41300-c6c7-11eb-8363-1ec3ec26a486.jpg" width= "510" height= "45"</p>

<p> Last point of supply (LPSY) is the last bullish phase marked by low volumes. C.O. has exhausted his supply and the price will gradually decrease. As we see it now, this Bitcoin rally is almost a book example of the Wyckoff cycle. </p>
