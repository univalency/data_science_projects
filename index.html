        <p> I have downloaded the tables with minute, hourly and daily information on BTC and ETH from https://www.CryptoDataDownload.com<\p>
        <p> Let's first load the Bitcoin tables and understand them</p>

        <p> open/close gives us prices at the beginning/end of a given time period. High/low are the highest and lowest prices attained during a given time period, respectively.Unix  - This is the unix timestamp or also known as "Epoch Time". We can use this to convert to your local timezone. Tradecount is simply the number of trades.</p>
	<p> The tables have most recent dates on top, so let's reverse them for convenience. Following Machine Learning etiquette, we should normalize data. As for prices, I prefer to keep them in original format, but we introduce another column which records relative price changes. It's called a return in trading.</p>
		
	<p>It is interesting to see how trading volume is related to the price change (return). Oh a daily scale, correlation between absolute change and volume is quite low:

	<p>However, if we look at a hourly scale, correlation is bigger <\p>

	<p>On a minute scale, it is even more significant <\p>

	<p>This is probably due to correction and high volatility of crypto assets.</p>
        <p> To start noticing patterns, we can simply plot BTC and ETH price charts.</p>
