        <p> I have downloaded the tables with minute, hourly and daily information on BTC and ETH from https://www.CryptoDataDownload.com<\p>
        <p> Let's load the tables and understand them</p>

        <p> open/close gives us prices at the beginning/end of a given time period</p>

        <p> It is interesting to see how trading volume is related to the price change (return). Oh a daily scale, correlation between absolute change and volume is quite low. However, if we look at a minute scale, correlation is more significant. This is probably due to correction and high volatility of crypto assets.</p>
