    <h1 id="head1"> A Wyckoffian view on the 2021 BTC bull run. </h1>
    

<p>The most recent bull run started in early February 2021 and ended almost 2 months later. Quite a few people noticed that it behaved almost in direct accordance with the Wyckoffian theory. In this article, we analyse it in detail. </p>

<p>The concept of a <b>Composite Operator</b> (C.O.) or Composite Person is central to Wyckoff. He proposed a concept where we should think of a single person operating on the market. This represents big institutional players (aka whales), whose behaviour is usually quite different from average retail traders. C.O. always acts to his own benefit, so he wants to buy low and sell high.</p>  

<p>C.O accumulates assets gradually, without causing too much market movement.  Here is a graph starting at 2020-07-25: daily volumes began to exceed 1.5 * 10^9 USDT only during the first major bull run up to 20 000. </p>

<p> Volume really explodes in early January: </p>

<p>We call this phase a buying climax (BCLX). According to Wyckoff, it is also characterised by wide price bars. Let’s plot daily highs and lows with dashed lines:</p>

<p>Climbing towards peak values, volatility remained relatively high</p>

<p> The next stage in Wyckoff model is automatic reaction (AR). It is characterised by a sharp sudden decrease. This is perhaps the most ambiguous position of a stock- either reaccumulation or distribution will follow. Looking at volume, we see another spike after AR which confirms reaccumulation-  we should wait for another bullish wave.  </p>

<p> The real Buying climax occurs at a third volume peak just above 55 000.  A resistance level is formed and AR gives us a support level.
The asset has now gained some momentum and a second rise (which Wyckoff dubs secondary test, ST) is expected. This is an opportunity for the C.O. to sell off a lot of his holdings to panic buyers and momentum traders who attempt to hop on the upward trend. Wyckoff expects relatively high volumes at this stage confirming the supply generated by C.O.

<p>Multiple ST’s can happen which adjust the resistance and support levels slightly. A slight dip in volume corresponds to what Wyckoff calls Sign of Weakness (SOW). This alerts us of the final upcoming rally.</p>
